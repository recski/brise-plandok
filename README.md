# brise-plandok

Information extraction from text documents of the zoning plan of the City of Vienna

Work supported by [BRISE-Vienna](https://smartcity.wien.gv.at/en/brise/) (UIA04-081), a European Union Urban Innovative Actions project.

__The [asail2021](https://github.com/recski/brise-plandok/tree/asail2021) tag contains the code in the state presented in our [2021 ASAIL paper](#references). Legacy code can be found in the [asail](./brise_plandok/asail) folder__.

## Requirements

Install the brise_plandok repository:

```bash
pip install .

# To follow changes
pip install -e .
```

Installing this repository will also install the `tuw_nlp` repository, a graph-transformation framework. To get to know more, visit https://github.com/recski/tuw-nlp.

Ensure that you have at least `Java 8` for the [alto](https://github.com/coli-saar/alto) library.

## Coding guidelines

This repository uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting and [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) for PEP8 compliance. To install the pre-commit hooks run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This creates the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file, which automatically reformats all the modified files prior to any commit.

### Run `black` separately

```bash
pip install black
black .
```

### Run `flake8` separately
```bash
pip install flake8
flake8 .
```

## Annotated Data Description

See [DATA.md](./DATA.md).

## Extraction service

### Start service with your own data

```bash
python brise_plandok/services/full_extractor.py -d <DATA_DIR>
```

Example: ` python brise_plandok/services/full_extractor.py -d data/train`


### Start service from Docker

The docker image downloads the data from our cloud storage.

```bash
# Build docker image
docker build --tag brise-attr-extraction .

# Start service
docker run -p 5000:5000 brise-attr-extraction
```

### Call service

You can now reach the service in both cases by calling `curl http://localhost:5000/<endpoint>/<doc_id>`. If the `doc_id` does not exist, `Not found` will be returned.

#### brise-extract-api

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/brise-extract-api/7377
```

#### psets

```bash
# To get minimal psets
curl http://localhost:5000/psets/7377

# To get full psets
curl http://localhost:5000/psets/7377?full=true
```

## Demo for attribute names only

To run the browser-based demo described in the paper (also available [online](https://ir-group.ec.tuwien.ac.at/brise-extract)), first start rule extraction as a service like this:

```bash
python brise_plandok/services/attribute_extractor.py
```

Then run the frontend with this command:

```bash
streamlit run brise_plandok/frontend/extract.py
```

To run the prover of our system, also start the prover service from this repository: https://github.com/adaamko/BRISEprover. This will start a small Flask service on port 5007 that will be used by the demo service.

The demo can then be accessed from your web browser at [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)

## Preprocessing

### Input data

All steps described below can be run on the sample documents included in this repository under [sample_data](./sample_data).

The preprocessed version of all plan documents (as of December 2020) can be
downloaded as [a single JSON file](https://url.tuwien.at/ndnre). If you would like
to customize preprocessing, you can also download the [raw text documents](https://url.tuwien.at/eydmo)

### NLP Pipeline

Extract section structure from raw text and run NLP pipeline (sentence segmentation, tokenization, dependency parsing):

```bash
python brise_plandok/preproc/plandok.py sample_data/txt/*.txt > sample_data/json/sample.jsonl
```

## Attribute extraction task

To run the current best rule-based extraction, see [here](brise_plandok/full_attribute_extraction/README.md).

To run experiments with [POTATO](https://github.com/adaamko/POTATO), see [here](brise_plandok/full_attribute_extraction/attribute/potato/README.md).

To have a look at our baseline experiments, see [here](./brise_plandok/baselines/README.md).

## Annotation process

## Development

## References

The rule extraction system is described in the following paper:

Gabor Recski, Bj√∂rn Lellmann, Adam Kovacs, Allan Hanbury: Explainable rule extraction via semantic graphs (...)

The demo also uses the deontic logic prover described in [this paper](http://www.collegepublications.co.uk/DEON/submission%20Ciabattoni%20Lellmann.pdf)

The preprocessing pipeline relies on the [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/#citing-stanza-in-papers) library
